## What is Workflow Snapshot & Replay?

Imagine having a **smart assistant** that watches how you code, learns from your development patterns, and helps you become more productive. That's exactly what Workflow Snapshot & Replay does!

### The Problem We Solve

- **Lost Development Knowledge**: How did you build that feature last month? 
- **Inefficient Workflows**: Repeating the same mistakes without realizing
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Difficulty showing teammates your development process
- **Learning Curve**: New developers struggling to understand project workflows

### Our Solution

**Workflow Snapshot & Replay** automatically:
1. **Records** every action you take while coding
2. **Analyzes** your workflow with advanced AI
3. **Documents** your process in beautiful Markdown reports
4. **Replays** your workflow on any machine, anytime


## Key Features

###  Automatic Workflow Recording
- **Zero Setup**: Just click "Start Recording" and work normally
- **Complete Capture**: Files, edits, terminal commands, everything
- **Smart Filtering**: Only captures meaningful development activities
- **Background Operation**: Never interrupts your flow

###  Advanced AI Analysis (No API Key Required!)

#### File-Level Deep Analysis
- **Code Quality Scoring**: Each file gets a quality score (0-100)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detects programming patterns and architectures
- **Function Analysis**: Identifies functions, imports, and code structure
- **Language Detection**: Automatically recognizes 15+ programming languages

#### Project-Level Intelligence
- **Project Type Detection**: React, Python, Java, .NET projects
- **Architecture Analysis**: MVC, Component-Service, Monolithic patterns
- **Framework Recognition**: Django, Express, Spring Boot, and more
- **Best Practice Recommendations**: Tailored to your tech stack

#### Real-Time Insights
```
Example AI Analysis:
 Project Type: Python Data Analysis Project
 Architecture: Script-based with modular functions
 Files Analyzed:
  ‚Ä¢ data_analyzer.py: Quality 85/100, Functions: analyze_data, generate_plot
  ‚Ä¢ requirements.txt: Dependency management, Suggestion: Pin versions
  ‚Ä¢ README.md: Documentation, Quality 70/100
  Recommendations:
  ‚Ä¢ Add error handling for HTTP requests
  ‚Ä¢ Setup virtual environment
  ‚Ä¢ Consider adding unit tests
```

###  Beautiful Documentation
- **Markdown Reports**: Professional, shareable documentation
- **Timeline View**: Step-by-step development process
- **Visual Insights**: Charts and metrics about your workflow
- **Export Options**: Share with team or save for later

###  Intelligent Replay
- **Cross-Platform**: Record on Windows, replay on Mac/Linux
- **Smart Reproduction**: Automatically recreates files, folders, commands
- **Educational Tool**: Perfect for tutorials and onboarding
- **Debugging Aid**: Reproduce bugs exactly as they occurred

###  Seamless Integration
- **Explorer Dashboard**: Control everything from VS Code's Explorer panel
- **One-Click Actions**: Start, stop, analyze, replay with single clicks
- **Command Palette**: Full keyboard shortcut support
- **No Context Switching**: Everything happens within your editor

## How It Works

### Step 1: Record Your Workflow
```
1. Open your project in VS Code/Cursor
2. Find "Workflow Snapshot & Replay" in Explorer panel
3. Click "‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Recording"
4. Code normally - create files, edit code, run commands
5. Click "‚èπÔ∏è Stop Recording" when done
```

### Step 2: Get AI Analysis
```
1. Click "ü§ñ AI Assistant" in the dashboard
2. Choose your analysis type:
   ‚Ä¢ "Analyze Current Workflow" - Deep file and project analysis
   ‚Ä¢ "Get Development Suggestions" - Personalized recommendations
   ‚Ä¢ "Optimize Workflow" - Find inefficiencies and improvements
   ‚Ä¢ "Explain Workflow" - Understand what you accomplished
```

### Step 3: Share and Replay
```
1. Click "üìã Generate Report" for beautiful Markdown documentation
2. Share the report with your team or save for reference
3. Use "üîÑ Replay Workflow" to reproduce the same steps anywhere
4. Perfect for tutorials, debugging, or onboarding new developers
```
