## What is Workflow Snapshot & Replay?

Workflow Snapshot & Replay is the world's first **AI-native VS Code extension** that automatically captures your development workflow, generates beautiful Markdown documentation, and enables seamless workflow reproduction across different environments.

### Core Innovation: "Development Session Recording"

Instead of manually documenting your development process, Workflow Snapshot & Replay automatically captures every action:

```typescript
/**
 * Captured Workflow Example
 * Session: USER_WORKFLOW_001
 * Duration: 45 minutes
 * Files Modified: 12
 * Commands Executed: 8
 * 
 * Timeline:
 * 14:30:15 - File created: src/components/UserAuth.tsx
 * 14:30:45 - Text changed: Added login validation logic
 * 14:31:20 - Terminal command: npm install express-validator
 * 14:32:10 - File opened: src/routes/auth.js
 * 14:33:05 - AI Analysis: "Consider adding rate limiting"
 * 
 * Replay Instructions:
 * 1. Create UserAuth.tsx component
 * 2. Implement validation logic
 * 3. Install express-validator package
 * 4. Configure authentication routes
 */
```
